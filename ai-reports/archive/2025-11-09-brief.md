# Daily Brief - Nov 09, 2025

## 📋 Project Goal
Smoothie Bar is launching a cannabis vape brand on Instagram, but faces a tricky challenge: Instagram bans direct product sales, and cannabis marketing regulations are strict. This project is building a complete marketing playbook that positions Smoothie Bar as a cultural brand that celebrates LA's creative scene—featuring artists, musicians, and skaters in authentic stories that naturally incorporate the product. The goal is to build an engaged community and brand awareness without feeling like traditional advertising, while showcasing the product's unique dual-strain feature that lets users blend different cannabis experiences.

## ✅ What's Been Done
The foundation is complete. We've created a full Instagram strategy with five distinct content types (called "pillars") that guide what to post and when. The crown jewel is the "Will it Blend?" series—a four-post series that's completely written and ready for the design team to turn into actual Instagram posts. This series introduces different strain combinations in an engaging, educational way that feels more like a mixology guide than a product ad. We've also established brand voice guidelines (how Smoothie Bar "talks" on social media), legal compliance rules for cannabis marketing, and templates that make creating future content faster and more consistent.

## 🚀 What's Left To Do
The remaining work focuses on filling out the content calendar with posts for the other four content pillars. We have "Will it Blend?" done, but need to create the actual posts for: Cultural Documentarian (stories about LA creatives), Consumer Education (how-to guides and cannabis information), Community Voices (featuring customer experiences), and Behind the Scenes (showing the brand's story and people). Each pillar needs multiple posts written and ready for design. We also need to build out a launch timeline that sequences these posts strategically, create engagement response templates so the social media team knows how to reply to comments consistently, and develop measurement guidelines to track what's working.

## 🔧 Technical Issues (Explained Simply)
Currently, there are no blocking technical problems. The project documentation is organized and accessible. The main limitation is that this is a content library and strategy guide—not an automated system. This means:

- **Manual content creation required** - Each post still needs to be written individually following the templates and guidelines we've created. Impact: More time-intensive than an automated solution, but allows for quality control and authentic brand voice.

- **Design team dependency** - All written content needs to be handed off to designers to create the actual Instagram graphics. Impact: There's a coordination step between content completion and being ready to publish.

- **No built-in scheduling system** - The playbook tells you what to post and when, but doesn't automatically schedule posts to Instagram. Impact: The social media team will need to use a separate tool (like Later or Hootsuite) to actually schedule and publish posts.
