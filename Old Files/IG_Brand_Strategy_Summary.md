# Instagram Cannabis Brand Strategy - Key Summary

## Project Overview
Developing a comprehensive Instagram strategy for a cannabis vape brand with dual-tank products, focusing on authentic LA cannabis culture representation and educational content.

## Content Pillar Framework (4-5 Pillars Established)

### 1. Flavor Insights, Pairings, and History
**Purpose**: Educational content about strain combinations and cannabis culture
**Format**: Structured posts with consistent template

**Template Structure**:
- Hook intro addressing strain selection process
- The Backstory (cultural/historical context of strains)
- Flavor Profile (sensory descriptions of each strain)
- Will it Blend? (curation process explanation)
- Perfect Pairings (complementary experiences)
- Culture Check (conversation starter)

**Key Decisions**:
- Focus on dual-tank vape products (two strains, can be used separately or together)
- Avoid effects language for legal compliance
- Professional tone with minimal emojis
- Arrow separators (→) for visual breaks
- Emphasis on curation expertise and craftsmanship

### 2. Consumer Education
**Purpose**: Build trust through expertise, address misconceptions, empower informed decisions
**Format**: Educational deep-dives with practical application

**Template Structure**:

- The Basics (fundamental concepts with analogies)
- Why It Matters (practical impact on experience/purchasing)
- The Real Story (context and nuanced truths)
- Pro Tips (actionable advice and red flags)
- Knowledge Check (discussion question)
- Your Turn (specific call-to-action)

**Key Topics Developed**:

- Terpene profiles and significance

**Key Decisions**:

### 3. Individual Lifestyle Interviews (In Development)
