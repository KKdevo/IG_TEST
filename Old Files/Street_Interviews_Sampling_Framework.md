Example Street Interview Post
LA VOICES: "What makes LA cannabis culture special?"

We hit the streets of Venice to ask locals what sets LA apart from everywhere else when it comes to cannabis culture.

"It's the diversity, man. You've got surfers, artists, tech people, everyone just living their life and cannabis is just part of it. It's not a big deal here, it's just normal life." - Marcus, Venice Beach

This is what we love about LA - cannabis isn't separate from culture, it IS the culture.

Example Sampling Video Post
REAL REACTIONS: First time trying dual-tank vaping

Meet Sarah, a budtender from West Hollywood who's been in the industry for 3 years but never tried a dual-tank system.

"Wait, I can control each strain separately? This is actually genius. I'm getting the citrus from one side and the earthiness from the other, but when I hit both... wow, that's a completely different experience."

When industry professionals get excited about innovation, you know you're onto something.

Have you tried dual-tank vaping? What was your experience?
