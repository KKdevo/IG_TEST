# Lifestyle Interview Framework - Development Document

## Project Context
Building on the established Instagram cannabis brand strategy, this document develops the Individual Lifestyle Interviews content pillar - a 4-part documentary-style series showcasing talented LA individuals and their authentic relationship with cannabis culture.

## Core Concept Recap
**Vision**: Authentic LA cannabis culture documentation through lifestyle footage that captures genuine city vibes and creative hustle, filling the gap in current media representation. LA culture is always senstialized or sanitized by the media. This creates
a gap that we can take advantage of and build a media presence that is independent of the market. This media presence can then be used
as an asset for different ends.

**Format**: 4-part interview series per individual (Dawn, Day, Dusk, Night) following their daily routine and cannabis integration.

**Strategic Goal**: Create talent incubation ecosystem where up-and-coming creatives become proto-brand ambassadors, allowing established influencers to easily promote rising talent rather than directly endorsing cannabis products.

6. EXAMPLE POSTS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER

Example Caption - Part 1: DAWN
PART 1: DAWN - Maya Rodriguez

Meet Maya, a 26-year-old muralist who's been transforming LA walls into stories for the past four years. What started as tagging abandoned buildings in Echo Park has evolved into commissioned pieces that capture the soul of different neighborhoods.

"I wake up every morning thinking about color - like, what does today feel like in terms of palette? Sometimes it's warm oranges and reds, sometimes it's cool blues. Cannabis helps me tap into that intuitive side before I even pick up a brush."

Maya represents the authentic creative hustle that makes LA special - turning passion into purpose, one wall at a time. Her morning routine includes meditation, coffee, and often a small vape session to "get in tune with the day's energy."

What does your creative morning routine look like? Drop it in the comments.

PART 2: DAY - Maya Rodriguez

Watching Maya work is like seeing meditation in motion. She's been working on this 40-foot mural in Arts District for three weeks, and today she's adding the final details that bring the whole piece to life.

"People think murals just happen, but there's so much planning. I sketch for weeks, then I have to think about how the light hits the wall at different times of day. Cannabis doesn't make me more creative - it helps me slow down enough to notice the details that matter."

This is what authentic LA creativity looks like - not the Instagram version, but the real process of turning vision into reality on the streets that raised you.

What's your creative process when you're really in the zone?

PART 3: DUSK - Maya Rodriguez

As the sun sets over LA, Maya transitions from artist to person. Her evening ritual is simple but intentional - she cleans her brushes, reviews the day's work, and chooses her consumption based on how she wants to feel.

"I'm really particular about my evening cannabis. If I want to keep thinking about the mural, I'll choose something more cerebral. If I need to decompress, I go for something that helps me let go of the day. It's about being intentional, not just consuming."

Maya's approach to cannabis reflects the thoughtful way she approaches everything - with purpose, respect, and awareness of how it fits into her larger goals.

How do you choose what to consume based on your evening plans?

PART 4: NIGHT - Maya Rodriguez

As we wrap up our day with Maya, she's reflecting on her journey from tagging walls to getting commissioned by the city she once painted illegally. Her advice for aspiring artists is simple but powerful.

"Don't wait for permission to create. LA has so many walls, so many stories that need telling. Start where you are, with what you have. The city will teach you the rest."

Maya's story represents the authentic LA creative spirit - turning rebellion into art, passion into profession, and always staying true to the streets that shaped you.
