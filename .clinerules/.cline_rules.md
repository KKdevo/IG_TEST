# Smoothie Bar IG Project Rules

## Content File Organization System

### Post Directory Structure
All Instagram content follows a **three-tier organizational structure** for version control:

```
Posts/
└── [content-pillar-name]/
    ├── aigen_[pillar]/       ← AI-generated caption versions (CLINE creates here)
    ├── actualpost_[pillar]/  ← Final versions posted to Instagram (user manages)
    └── (root folder)         ← Workspace for in-progress versions/iterations
```

### File Creation Rules

**CRITICAL:** When creating AI-generated Instagram content, ALWAYS place files in the appropriate `aigen_` subfolder:

#### Active Content Pillars:
1. **Will it Blend Series**
   - Create files in: `Posts/will-it-blend-series/aigen_WIB/`
   - Example: `Posts/will-it-blend-series/aigen_WIB/006_new_post.md`

2. **Consumer Education**
   - Create files in: `Posts/consumer-education/aigen_edu/`
   - Example: `Posts/consumer-education/aigen_edu/002_terpene_guide.md`

3. **Future Pillars** (when created):
   - Street Interviews: `Posts/street-interviews/aigen_SI/`
   - Individual Lifestyles: `Posts/individual-lifestyles/aigen_IL/`
   - Community Engagement: `Posts/community-engagement/aigen_CE/`

#### Folder Purposes:
- **aigen_[pillar]/** - My AI-generated drafts go here (I create files here)
- **actualpost_[pillar]/** - User manages final published versions
- **Root folder** - User's workspace for iterations and working drafts

### Workflow Examples

#### Correct ✅
```
# Creating a new Will it Blend post
<write_to_file>
<path>Posts/will-it-blend-series/aigen_WIB/006_new_blend.md</path>
```

#### Incorrect ❌
```
# DO NOT create in root or wrong folder
<write_to_file>
<path>Posts/will-it-blend-series/006_new_blend.md</path>  # Wrong: not in aigen_ folder
<path>Posts/006_new_blend.md</path>  # Wrong: missing pillar folder
<path>Posts/will-it-blend-series/actualpost_WIB/006_new_blend.md</path>  # Wrong: actualpost is for user only
```

### Benefits of This System
1. **Version Control** - Clear separation of AI drafts vs. final published content
2. **Learning Loop** - Easy comparison to refine AI output based on actual posts
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete history from draft → working versions → published
4. **Workspace Flexibility** - Root folder for iterations without cluttering organized versions
5. **Content Pillar Organization** - Each series/topic is self-contained

### File Naming Convention
- Use sequential numbering: `001_`, `002_`, etc.
- Use underscores for spaces: `will_it_blend_intro.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `003_lava_pop_tropicana.md`
- Always use `.md` extension for Instagram caption content

## Memory Bank Integration
This file organization system is documented in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and should be referenced at the start of each session to ensure proper file placement.

## Project Context
This is an Instagram content strategy project for Smoothie Bar, a cannabis vape brand. Content focuses on:
- Dual-tank strain combinations ("Will it Blend?" series)
- Consumer education (COA guides, terpene info, etc.)
- LA cannabis culture authenticity
- Educational authority building

See `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` for complete project overview.
