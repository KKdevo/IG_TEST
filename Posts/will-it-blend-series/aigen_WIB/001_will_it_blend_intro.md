"Will it Blend?" 

It's the question behind every Smoothie Bar: Blend product, and we're bringing you along for the journey that follows every strain pairing we create. 

Not every pairing works. Some strains clash, others complement, and a few create something entirely new. In these posts, we'll dive into why we believe certain strains belong together and go behind-the-scenes of the Smoothie Bar strain selection process.

First, an important note on technology - our dual-tank, ceramic-coil device is crucial to testing each strain solo before experiencing them together. It's the perfect setup for understanding what each brings to the combination and whether they truly blend or just coexist. Now the real fruits of our labor…

Within our vault of genetics and extracts, each strain carries its own fingerprint - terpene profiles, cultural heritage, cultivation story, and numerous other factors we deem important. Our selection process considers all these elements: Do the terpenes complement or contrast in interesting ways? Do their origins tell a compelling story together? Most importantly, do they maintain their individual character while creating something new? 

It's the appreciation of chemistry, culture, and intuition that drive our industry and the ethos behind Smoothie Bar & our products.
