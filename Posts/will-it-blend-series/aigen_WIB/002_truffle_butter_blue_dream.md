## Caption

Welcome to the first strain combination featured on Smoothie Bar's "Will it Blend?" series: Truffle Butter x Blue Dream.
Let's dive in to what makes this Blend one of Smoothie Bar's favorite offerings, and go behind the scenes of our selection 
proecss.

**THE BACKSTORY**
Blue Dream became one of California's most recognized strains during the medical cannabis era of the early 2000s. Dispensaries consistently stocked it, and it became a benchmark for quality on the West Coast. Truffle Butter emerged from California's craft cultivation scene around 2018, gaining recognition among connoisseurs for its distinctive dessert-like aroma profile. Together, they represent different generations of California cannabis cultivation.

**FLAVOR PROFILE**
Blue Dream is known for its sweet berry aroma with hints of blueberry. Truffle Butter brings rich chocolate and vanilla scent notes that have made it popular among those who appreciate dessert-like aromas. When you Blend the strains, the bright blueberry berry sweetness and vanilla cream create a sweet and decadent, yet satisfying and refreshing smoke.

**WILL IT BLEND?**
At first, the combination of these strains was not something we considered. An experience with a Truffle Butter flower joint infused with Blue Dream extract sent us down the path of bringing this combination to a vaporizer form that can be enojoyed on the go. Since then, the Blend 2.0 Truffle Butter x Blue Dream has become an internal favorite. The sweet blueberry cream notes and the ability to switch between the nostalgic blue dream sativa to a new age indica cemented this combo as a winner. Oftentimes, unexpected experiences such as these end up teaching us more about the flavors of cannabis than classic pairings we know and love.

**CULTURE CHECK**
As it happens, these strains represent different eras of California cannabis culture - Blue Dream's medical movement legacy and Truffle Butter's craft cultivation emergence. What are your thoughts on this combo?
