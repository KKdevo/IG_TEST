## Caption

Dark Web x Agent Orange sounds like a weird combination, but this gassy-candy-meets-fresh-citrus pairing is actually genius.

Sometimes the best blends come from putting opposites together and seeing what happens.

**THE BACKSTORY**
Dark Web emerged from California's underground breeding scene in the mid-2010s, gaining a cult following for its intense, gassy aroma with sweet candy undertones. Agent Orange has been popular on the West Coast for years, known for its bright orange citrus profile that actually smells like fresh oranges. Both strains represent different ends of the flavor spectrum but share that California experimental breeding culture.

**FLAVOR PROFILE**
Dark Web hits you with that gassy, fuel-like aroma first, but there's this underlying candy sweetness that keeps it interesting. Agent Orange is all bright citrus - fresh orange peel, zesty, clean. When you experience them together, the citrus cuts through the gas while the earthy depth adds complexity to the orange brightness. It's like having a sophisticated cocktail where each sip reveals different layers.

**WILL IT BLEND?**
Here's the thing - Dark Web brings this deep, earthy foundation with sweet notes, while Agent Orange adds brightness and clarity. They don't try to be similar. Instead, they create this back-and-forth conversation between earth and citrus, heavy and light, complex and clean. It's the kind of pairing that keeps your palate guessing.

**PERFECT PAIRINGS**
→ Craft cocktails with citrus garnish  
→ Hip-hop or electronic music with deep bass  
→ Evening sessions when you want something complex
