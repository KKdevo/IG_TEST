## Caption (240 words)

The Certificate of Analysis is the standard for reporting cannabis test results, but the technical aspects often get misinterpreted by consumers and industry professionals alike. At Smoothie Bar, we believe understanding COA components and terminology arms consumers with knowledge to make informed choices, pushing the community toward a safer future.

**COA SECTIONS**
A comprehensive Certificate of Analysis includes: Product Identification, Cannabinoid Analysis, Terpene Profiles, Pesticide Screening, Heavy Metals Testing, Residual Solvent Analysis, and Microbial Testing. Each section verifies different aspects of product quality and safety.

**TERMINOLOGY DECODED**
LOD (Limit of Detection) represents the smallest amount the lab can reliably identify. LOQ (Limit of Quantification) indicates the lowest measurable concentration with acceptable precision. "ND" (Not Detected) means nothing was found above the LOD threshold. PPM is parts per million (equivalent to 1mg per 1kg).

**KEY SECTIONS EXPLAINED**
Cannabinoid Analysis shows active compound concentrations (THC, CBD, CBG, CBN). Total THC is calculated by adding existing THC to 87.7% of THCA percentage. Contaminant Screening covers pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, and microbials - all should show "ND" or levels below safety limits.

At Smoothie Bar, we believe informed consumers make better choices. All our products exceed regulatory standards. Scan the QR code on your Smoothie Bar product to access the full COA.

**SLIDE 3: Terminology Guide**
- Visual: Close-up of COA showing LOD, LOQ, ND examples
- Text Overlay: "Lab Language Decoded 🧪"
- Design Note: Circle or highlight the actual terms on a real COA, use arrows pointing to specific values

**SLIDE 4: Cannabinoid Focus**
- Visual: Cannabinoid table highlighted with THC/CBD percentages visible
- Text Overlay: "Beyond THC Percentages 🎯"
- Design Note: Highlight the full cannabinoid profile, not just THC

**SLIDE 5: Safety First**
- Visual: Contaminant testing sections showing "PASS" results
- Text Overlay: "Clean & Safe Results ✅"
- Design Note: Show multiple "PASS" or "ND" results, use green highlighting for positive results

**DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:**
