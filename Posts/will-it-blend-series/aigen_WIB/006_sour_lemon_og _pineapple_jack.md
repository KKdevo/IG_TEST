Sour Lemon OG × Pineapple Jack is one of those blends where the brightness, the tartness, and the tropical layers all intersect in a way that feels intentional...because it is.

**THE BACKSTORY**:
Sour Lemon OG traces back to California’s love for sharp, sativa-leaning citrus strains. It became known for its clean lemon-zest bite and uplifting aromatic profile. Pineapple Jack, a descendant of Jack Herer lineages, brought a tropical twist to the citrus category. pineapple sweetness, energetic aroma, and a signature “sunny” character. Both strains represent California’s citrus wave era, where growers experimented with high-terpene, fruit-forward genetics.
