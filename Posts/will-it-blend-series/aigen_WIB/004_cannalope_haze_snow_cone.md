## Caption

Cannalope Haze x Snow Cone is basically summer in a vape. This combination takes everything good about melon sweetness and adds that perfect cooling finish.

Think of it as the cannabis version of a perfect summer day.

**THE BACKSTORY**
Cannalope Haze has been around since the early 2000s, originally bred by DNA Genetics. It became popular for its distinct cantaloupe aroma and became a staple in dispensaries across California. Snow Cone is newer to the scene, developed by craft breeders who wanted to capture that refreshing, cooling sensation in cannabis form. Both strains represent the sweeter side of cannabis breeding.

**FLAVOR PROFILE**
Cannalope Haze delivers that signature cantaloupe sweetness - fresh melon, tropical fruit notes that hit you right away. Snow Cone brings cooling menthol-like notes with sweet undertones. When you experience both together, you get this natural progression from sweet melon to cooling finish. It's like eating fresh cantaloupe with a mint garnish - each element enhances the other.

**WILL IT BLEND?**
This pairing works because both strains share sweetness as a foundation, but they approach it from different angles. Cannalope Haze provides the fruit-forward base, while Snow Cone adds that cooling, refreshing element that makes the sweetness more complex. Instead of competing flavors, they create this natural flow that feels like summer refreshment.

**PERFECT PAIRINGS**
→ Fresh fruit salads or agua frescas  
→ Chill summer playlists or beach vibes music  
→ Poolside sessions or outdoor relaxation
