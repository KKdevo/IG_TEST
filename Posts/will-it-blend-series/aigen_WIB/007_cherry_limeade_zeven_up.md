CHERRY LIMEADE × ZEVEN UP : Sweet Cherry meets soda clarity. Chill out after a long day partying under the sun. 

                                        Cherry Up!

**THE BACKSTORY**
Cherry Limeade came up in craft circles for that obvious tart-cherry top note balanced with lime tension—think fruit-stand candy, but grown and cured. Zeven Up is engineered for clarity: clean lemon-lime aromatics and a finish that snaps.

**FLAVOR PROFILE**
Cherry Limeade: upfront tart cherry, subtle lime peel, a juicy sweetness.

**WILL IT BLEND?**
 Cherry Limeade provides the juicy backbone; Zeven Up brings the crisp, soda-pop lift. The contrast is cooperative, not combative: sweet meets sharp; body meets fizz.


**PERFECT PAIRINGS**:
 → Sunny patio hangs or easy social afternoons
 → Sparkling water with fresh cherries or a chilled mocktail
 → Light bites: ceviche, fruit platters, or lemon-sugar cookies


**CULTURE CHECK**:
If this blend were a drink, what would it be? A cherry-lime spritzer? A street-cart refresher? Drop your pick below!
